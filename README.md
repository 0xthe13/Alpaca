## Thanks
So, apparently there's people who like something I did, that's cool. I mean really, this is the first big project I've made and there's still a lot of stuff I want to add, I wanted to thank all of you that have reported issues and enhancements to the app, I appreciate it a lot.

## About forks
If you want to fork this... I mean, I think it would be better if you start from scratch, my code isn't well documented at all, but if you really want to, please give me some credit, that's all I ask for... And maybe a donation (joke)
