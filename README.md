## Preview
1. Clone repo using Gnome Builder
2. Press the `run` button

## Instalation
1. Go to the `releases` page
2. Download the latest flatpak package
3. Open it

## Usage
- You'll need an Ollama instance, I recommend using the [Docker image](https://ollama.com/blog/ollama-is-now-available-as-an-official-docker-image)
- Once you open Alpaca it will ask you for a url, if you are using the same computer as the Ollama instance and didn't change the ports you can use the default url.
- You might need a model, you can get one using the box icon at the top of the app, I recommend using phi3 because it is very lightweight but you can use whatever you want (I haven't actually tested all so your mileage may vary).
- Then just start talking! you can mix different models, they all share the same conversation, it's really cool in my opinion.

## About forks
If you want to fork this... I mean, I think it would be better if you start from scratch, my code isn't well documented at all, but if you really want to, please give me some credit, that's all I ask for... And maybe a donation (joke)
